I recommend looking at every single video settings option and deciding whether you need to alter them or not. You can see which setting does what by hovering over it with your mouse for a second.

Tip: Keep "Show FPS" off. There's a modpack that already shows it for you.

Extra Tip: Your render distance on the server is hard capped to 20. This means if your client settings exceed this, and you have it set to 32. The server will only show the chunks as if you had it at 20. I've capped it at this so everyone runs smoothly.

Bonus Tip: The profile you install comes with a special resource pack if you'd like to enable it.
